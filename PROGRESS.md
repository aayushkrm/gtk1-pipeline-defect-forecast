# PROGRESS.md — audit log (append-only)

## 2026-10-03 — Study complete, build started
- Studied: Project_info.md, 6 images, 1 dashboard video (4 frames), 6 sections / 32 files.
- Key findings: 44/45-col anomaly schema (R4 header), pipes 20→30 cols; threshold drift (PK-2 164→9→55/km); Pipe No join 11788/11858, odometer ±2m match 72.6%/53.4%; no persistent SSID; 0% coords; 5 corrupt/truncated files; TECH/ARTD/GOUG code reuse; 2016 Service-life=100y fictive.
- Decision: unit = pipe (join on Pipe No), aggregates 100m/1km; normalize Depth≥10%; longitudinal pairs ON 2016→2021→2025 (reference).
- Scaffolded `gtk1-forecast/` repo; raw data excluded by `.gitignore`.
- Next: cheap ETL diagnostic (ON reference pair), literature sweep, validation spec. No model claims yet.
